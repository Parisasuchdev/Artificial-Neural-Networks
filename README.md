# Artificial Neural Networks

This repository contains code and resources for learning and implementing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using Python.

## Introduction

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a type of machine learning model that are inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons in the brain. ANNs have been successfully used in a variety of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.

This repository provides code and resources for learning about ANNs and implementing them using Python in Jupyter notebooks.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that provide explanations and examples of ANNs, as well as code for implementing them.
- data: This directory contains example datasets that can be used for training ANNs.

## Getting started

To get started with using this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory to learn about and experiment with ANNs.
3. Use the code in the notebooks to implement your own ANNs for your specific use case.
