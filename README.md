This is the fundamental application of artificial neural networks that students in Dr. Donna Rizzo's course at the University of Vermont learnt. The task was divided into two parts: I) a complete implementation of ANNs in Python, and II) reports on the observations of the algorithm's working.

Below are some of the algorithm learned during the class with suggested readings:
1. Backpropagation: [Neurocomputing](https://bb.uvm.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-4334595-dt-content-rid-88811525_1/courses/202209-EY-Crosslisted/ArtificialNeuralNetworks_Neurocomputing_Backprop_%20GradientDescent.pdf)
2. Hopfield: [Hopfield 1982](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.79.8.2554), [Hopfield 1984](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.81.10.3088)
